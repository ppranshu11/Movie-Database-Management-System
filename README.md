**Movie Database â€“ SQL Schema**
**Summary**
This project contains the SQL schema for a Movie Database System, which is designed to store and manage data related to movies, actors, directors, users, and their ratings. It includes the structure for creating the necessary tables and establishing relationships between them using primary and foreign keys.

**Schema Overview**
The SQL file defines the following key components:

Movies: Stores basic details like title, year, and genre.

Actors & Directors: Maintains personal details (name, birthdate) for individuals involved in movies.

Casting: Links actors with their roles in movies.

Direction: Connects directors to the movies they directed.

Users: Contains data about users who rate or review movies.

Ratings: Stores movie ratings provided by users.

**Features & Design Highlights**
Relational Structure: Proper use of foreign keys ensures referential integrity across entities like actors, movies, and users.

Normalized Design: Data redundancy is minimized through normalization, supporting scalability and clarity.

Ready for Integration: Easily adaptable for a web or mobile-based movie recommendation or review system.
